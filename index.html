          target="_blank">Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual</a>
        <p>For my Interactive Audio & Visual project, I made a Pirates of the Caribbean themed soundboard. 
          I was inspired to make this project during a flight to Washington DC this semester. I get nervous on airplanes, so on the flight 
          there I decided to unwind and watch my favorite Disney movie & theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. I felt super nostalgic 
          watching the movie and I wanted to make a fun project, so I compiled soundbites from the ride and made a soundboard with them.
          I couldn't find any clear audio from the newer ride, so I had to cut up a recording from 2006 in Premiere, which wasn't 
          that difficult but made me realized that the ride used to be pretty offensive. The 
          eight icons each play a different sound from the Disneyland ride, while the big pirate flag in the middle is used to stop the audio 
          from playing. When an icon is clicked, it turns from black to red.</p>

          target="_blank">Project 2: HyperNarrative</a>
        <p>My HyperNarrative project manifested as an interactive, non-linear website titled "Manna From Hell."
           By scrolling through different pages and engaging with text, the site navigates users 
           through the journey of oil. Beginning as organic matter 
           trapped under the sea floor for millions of years, the once-living tissue becomes
          crude oil, coursing through the Earth's veins deep below the surface. Man draws this blood
        with pumps and wells and distills it into its many forms. Users then choose between the paths of fuel
        and plastic, following the journey of man-made material and it's eventual return to the Earth, once 
        again becoming "Manna From Hell". While the project is more experimental, my hope is that it will
        educate users towards the pervasiveness of fossil fuel products in our world, and that with this information
        they can become involved in climate initiatves and make more educated purchases as consumers.</p>

        <a class="shaky-hover" 
          href="https://bregev08.github.io/iml300/project-3/" 
          target="_blank">Project 3: Networked Care</a>
        <p>For my Networked Care project, I developed a website titled the "Los Angeles County
          Heat Equity Map". The project focuses on how heat effects six distinct regions of Los Angeles County, including
          South Bay & the Gateway Cities, the Westside, Central & South LA, the San Fernando Valley,
          the San Gabriel Valley, and North LA County. The landing page of the site displays a map of
          the county where users can click on one of six regions and be directed to a new page focusing on
          the area of their choice. Each region's page begins with a short summary of how heat is experienced
          there, and the unique environmental and structural variables which affect it. Users then scroll
          down the page, where they can view and interact with different images and graphs. By clicking on
          an image, an information and data tab will appear next to it, providing in-depth research about 
          heat in that area. Each region has tabs for regional overviews, heat indicators, historical trends,
          solutions and interventions, and community resources. Los Angeles County is one of the most heat
          vulnerable areas in the country, and my hope is that this website will educate users and allow them
          to support initiatives that bolster heat equity across the region.</p>

      <h3> Thoughts and reflection on vibe coding </h3>
      <p>Prior to this class, I had never vibe coded before and I didn't know what it was.
          Despite my mixed feelings about AI, I enjoyed our 10 vibe coding assignments. They
          made me engage with the weekly texts in a more meaningful way and overall, I was impressed
          with the capabilities of platorms like Claude and Loveable. One aspect of vibe coding I was 
          suprised to learn was the best methods to prompt and conversate with the AI. As we worked through
          different weekly assignments, my ability to prompt the AI and initiate it to make edits to the website
          improved, and the quality of the websites did as well. There are obvious drawbacks and limitations, such as the AI's 
          tendency to choose consistent color palettes, shapes, and website interface features. Prompting AI
          to make the edits you want can be very frustrating as well, as sometimes the program misinterprets 
          what it is you're asking for. I'm generally wary of AI, especially in creative work, as I feel it can detract
          from an individual's critical thinking and creative process, which I've experienced firsthand. However, 
          I also see the merit in vibe coding as a tool to democratize access to web design, and as an
          assistant to help with debugging and brainstorming. As a complete beginner to coding and web design,
          having access to AI to help me debug my code was incredibly useful.
